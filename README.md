# vd-pkgtool
Bash script to make a gui for some common packaging commands for void linux usig gtkdialog and zenity.  Gksu, lxterminal and gnome-keyring are also needed to make it work.

10/09/17 Changed upgrade from using gksu to sudo and entirely terminal based to better see any errors that may come up.

01/12/18 Eliminated code lines using gksu since gksu is deprecated

08/15/20 Added entry to upgrade individual file like xbps
